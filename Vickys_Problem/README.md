Vicky's Problem
A frog called Vickey can jump then rests.

Jumps 5m, rests for 3s
Jumps 3m, rests for 2s
Jumps 1m, rests for 3s
And repeats.

{m-》meters
 s-》seconds}

Write a java program which will get the user to input distance to travel, 
calculate and output how long it will take. Assume jump doesn't take time.
